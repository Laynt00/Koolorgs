# A small version of Coolors with Kologs

 As a color blind person I thought: -Hey, wouldn't be cool to develop a web color based?!, what can go wrong?!.
 So now you can copy palettes of colors stolen directly from Kologs!. (Currently on construction)

 For this proyect I'm using:

- Value.js to manage colors from [@noeldelgado/values.js](https://github.com/noeldelgado/Values.js/)
- React [React website](https://es.react.dev/)
